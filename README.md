# Sokoban

Sokoban (Warehouse Man) is a Japanese game. The goal is to push crates into their storage spots in the warehouse. The elements of the levels are simple: The "person", crates, walls, open floor, and storage.
Different symbols represent each figure:

* "@"       for the person
* "o"      for crates
* "#"       for walls
* " " for open floor
* ". "      for storage
* "\*"       for crate on storage
* "+"     for man on storage

Right now the game is only one level. To play, run `ruby sokoban.rb`.
